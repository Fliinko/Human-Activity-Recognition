Ball Tree

The Ball Tree Algorithm can be viewed as a 'Metric Tree' Algorithm.
Metric Trees or Ball Trees organize and structure data points considering
the dimensional plane in which the points are located. Therefore, using
metrics, the points are not restricted to a finite dimensional relationship.
-from (Kumar, Zhang & Nayar, 2008)
 
How does the Ball Tree work?
 
The data points are divided into two clusters in the shape of circles or
hyperspheres (spheres in essence), where each cluster is set to be a
node of a tree. 
 
A point is selected. Considering this point, the algorithm searches for the farthest node to that point, where a vector which splits the data in half is plotted. All of the other data points are projected onto the vector. The median of the vector is found. With the median and a vector from point 0 to point N in mind, the algorithm plots two spheres or circles where one clusters from point 0 to the median, and the other from the median to N. The process is repeated considering the radius and the mean of the circles, creating 2 new circles in each circle, and hence, the tree is formed. 
 
What is the Curse of Dimensionality?
 
The Curse of Dimensionality describes the problem in a high dimensional space where the data points are represented to be extremely close to one another and the KNN algorithm finds it difficult to cluster accordingly.
 
Advantages
 
Comparative to KD Trees, the Ball Tree is not much of a victim to the Curse of Dimensionality. This is due to use of metric points.
